# Hello, I'm Abrar Fahyaz 👋

I'm an undergraduate student at the **University of Dhaka**, studying **Computer Science and Engineering**. One of my primary interests lies in **linguistics-based models**, exploring the intersection of **natural language processing (NLP)** and **machine learning**. I am also particularly interested in **Neuromorphic computing**.
