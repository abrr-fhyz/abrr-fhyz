# Hello, I'm Abrar Fahyaz 👋

I'm an undergraduate student at the **University of Dhaka**, studying **Computer Science and Engineering**. My primary interest lies in **linguistics-based models**, where I explore the intersection of **natural language processing (NLP)** and **machine learning**.

## 🔍 Interests:
- Machine Learning
- Natural Language Processing (NLP)
- Model FineTuning
- Computational Linguistics
- Artificial Intelligence
- App Development

## 🚀 Projects:
- **[ShN Code Editor]**: A lightweight text editor developed using the Qt framework in C/C++, designed for simplicity and ease of use. It has several features including, but not limited to, in-built compiliation capabilities, in-editor file explorer, and language specific highlighting.
- **[ShareTune]**: A custom music player developed from scratch using Java and JavaFX. The program is capable of streaming music to other devices using an in-built server mode.
- **[War Simulator]**: A map editor designed to depict modern conventional warfare, developed using Java and JavaFX. The application includes a comprehensive account of the 1971 Bangladesh Liberation War including all referenced sources.
- **[DU_fthrlss_bpds bot]**: A simple bot created using Vue.js that can perform the functions of chatGPT, and can be connected to another server if the need arises.
